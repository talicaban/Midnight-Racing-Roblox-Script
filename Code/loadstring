      I don't recommend using the loadstring below because there are some values that you are suppose to tune on the raw script.
      However, at the same time, using the loadstring method will allow you automatically get the latest version of my script.
      I still have some op values inside the raw script, so it's up to you whether or not to use this script over the raw code.
      
      *THIS CODE IS NOT DONE AND WILL NOT WORK
